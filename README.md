This application is designed for theatre producers to list their upcoming show in a clear format without a lot of “noise.”  The main components are there for the visitors to the website to see a show’s listing, the date/time that is goes up, the name of the producer and the producing company, and the theatre/venue that the show is performing in. 

Visitors  can sort lists of performances by state.  They can also view a list of performances by theatre/venue, or by a list of performances by the producer.  The performances listed are shown with upcoming events listed first (next performance on top), and in the past (most recent on top).
A producer can sign-up for an account either through traditional login with an email, and/or with GitHub.  Once logged in, a producer can add an event which will belong to and be the responsibility for the producer/user, and they can edit their own profile.  Also, an producer can add a venue to the venue database.  However, once added, venues can only be edited (not deleted), and they can be edited by any producer who is logged in.  Also, all producers can add event listings using any theatre/venue in the database.
